  "summary": "The diff implements core navigation and screen structure for REQ-16 and REQ-17, with settings persistence for REQ-18. However, the truncated diff prevents complete verification of all acceptance criteria, particularly theme implementation details and full screen functionality.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Verify that the app theme (light/dark mode) is working correctly with the blue/green/white color palette and consistent styling across all screens",
      "reason": "While ThemeProvider is present in App.tsx and settings store persists theme preferences, the diff does not show the actual theme toggle implementation in ProfileSettings screen or theme color definitions. The index.css file is mentioned in summaries but not shown in the diff, making it impossible to verify the blue/green/white palette implementation.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Ensure all existing screens are functioning correctly with their mock data and interactive features",
      "reason": "The diff summary lists all required screens in frontend-file-summaries.txt, but the actual screen implementations are not shown in the diff. Cannot verify that all interactive features (chart rendering, position management, alert CRUD, playback controls, etc.) are correctly implemented without seeing the screen component code.",

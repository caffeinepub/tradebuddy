# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebuild and deploy the existing TradeBuddy app, ensuring the Welcome screen navigation works correctly and all existing screens function properly with consistent theming.

**Planned changes:**
- Verify Welcome screen displays first on app load and Continue button navigates to Home Dashboard
- Confirm bottom navigation is hidden on Welcome screen and visible on all other main screens
- Test all existing screens (Home Dashboard, Learning, Trading, Demo Trading, Alerts, Live Chart Practice, Profile/Settings) with their mock data and interactive features
- Verify light/dark theme toggle works correctly across all screens with the blue/green/white color palette

**User-visible outcome:** The app loads with the Welcome screen first, allows navigation to the Home Dashboard, and all existing screens function correctly with consistent theming and mock data interactions.
